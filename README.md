# price_watcher
A little python program to monitor prices of products online


The user can add the URL link to the program. And the program allows the user to check the prices of multiple products simultaneously and suggests the user which one of them on the wishlist is on sale (prices drop below its price when being added).

Right now the program supports the products from Nike.com and Amazon.
