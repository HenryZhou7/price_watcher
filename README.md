# price_watcher
A little python program to monitor prices of products online


The user can add the URL link to the program. And the program allows the user to check the prices of multiple products simultaneously and suggests the user which one of them on the wishlist is on sale (the current price of a product drop below its price when being added).

To use this little tool, clone this repository to your local directory. Run main_program.py. Detailed manual of the program is integrated in the program.

Hope you can enjoy using it!

Right now the program supports the products from Nike.com and Amazon.
